#K-Means Clustering

Implement K-Means Clustering.  Write a function that takes in an $n\times m$
data matrix and a value for $k$, and returns a $k\times m$ matrix of
centroids, an $n\times 1$ vector of integers describing which cluster each row
belongs to, and the average distance from every data point to its centroid.

Plot the average distance as a function of $k$.

Run this on the MNIST data set.  For an informed choice of $k$, display the
$k$ centroids.
